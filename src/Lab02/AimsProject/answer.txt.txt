7.	Trả lời câu hỏi
7.1.	If you create a constructor method to build a DVD by title then create a constructor method to build a DVD by category. Does JAVA allow you to do this?
Yes. In Java, you can have multiple constructor methods in a class as long as they have different parameter lists. This is known as constructor overloading. So, you can create a constructor method to build a DVD by title and another constructor method to build a DVD by category, as long as the parameter lists for these constructors are different.
7.2.	When should accessor methods be used?
Accessor methods, also known as getter methods, should be used in Java and many other object-oriented programming languages when you want to access the value of an object's private fields (or instance variables) from outside the class. These methods are important for encapsulation, a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming, as they provide controlled access to the internal state of an object.
